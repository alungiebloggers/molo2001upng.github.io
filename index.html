<p>Hi, My name is Mackay, I am from the upper highlands of Papua New Guinea.
I am keen on learning new things. My motto is that together we can achieve great things.
I am from Hela, and if you would like to know something about my culture and how
we live day by day, then I suggest you read here

<p>I am still trying the to grab the basics of web creation and running it.
My interest and hobby are fishing and playing footy, respectively.
I could go out in the morning and return in the afternoon just for fishing.
I am a outdoor person, spend most of my time in the bush either hunting with
my brothers at night or gone night diving. I have visited every districts in Hela.
And to be honest, my homeland, Koroba Lake Koiago is peaceful and the most beautiful
place you could ever find yourself in.

was when I completed grade 9. It took me almost a day on how master the and ride a
conoe. Was an awesome experience for me.</p>
